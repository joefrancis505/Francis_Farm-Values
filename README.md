This repository contains the data and scripts underlying the paper “Did Slavery Impede the Growth of American Capitalism? Two Natural Experiments Using Farm Values per Acre” by Joseph Francis.
The scripts to run the regressions are “RDD_v11.R” and “DiD_v2.R”. The other scripts recreate the databases used by those two scripts.
For the DiD database, “DiD_database_v3.R” should be followed by “DiD_normalization_v3.R”, which will take some time to run, depending on your system.
If you see any issue with the data or scripts, please do contact me at joefrancis505@gmail.com.
